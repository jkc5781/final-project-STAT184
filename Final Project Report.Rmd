library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(lubridate)
library(DataComputing)
```

## Guiding Question:

# Are suicide rates and world happiness inversely correlated?

<br>

## Data Access

```{r}
SuicideRates <-
  read.csv(file.choose())
```

```{r}
WorldHappiness2015 <-
  read.csv(file.choose())
```

```{r}
WorldHappiness2016 <-
  read.csv(file.choose())
```

```{r}
head(SuicideRates)
head(WorldHappiness2015)
head(WorldHappiness2016)
```



## Data Wrangling

# Joined World Happiness (.x is 2015 and .y is 2016)
```{r}
WorldHappiness <-
  WorldHappiness2015 %>%
  full_join(WorldHappiness2016, by = c("Country" = "Country"))
view(WorldHappiness)
```

```{r}
RecentSuicideRates <-
  SuicideRates %>%
  filter(year == 2015 | year == 2016)
view(RecentSuicideRates)
```

```{r}
RecentSuicideRates %>%
  select(country, year, sex, age, population, suicides_no, suicides.100k.pop)

```
